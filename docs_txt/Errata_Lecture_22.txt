INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

RHS = ZERO 
(incompressible 
continuity eqn)

ρ∞V. ∇ 𝑒   =  0

Possibility #1

Possibility #3

V. ∇ 𝑒   =  0

Possibility #2

V  = 0
Hydrostatics

𝑒 = constant
Isothermal (if fluid is 
calorically perfect)

V and ∇ 𝑒  are 
orthogonal
Flow aligned with isotherms

Error in Lecture (at 18:47 mark): Only the isothermal possibility was 
assumed in the lecture. Hat-tip to Prakash Singh for pointing this out.
