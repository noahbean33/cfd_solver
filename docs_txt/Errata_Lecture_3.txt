Series 
Expansion

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Example of a Taylor Series Approximation

2

𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑎 + 𝑥 − 𝑎 𝑓′ 𝑎 +

3
𝑥−𝑎 2
2!

𝑓′′ 𝑎 +

4
𝑥−𝑎 3
3!

𝑓′′′ 𝑎 + ⋯

Let 𝑓 𝑥 = sin 𝑥 ; 𝑎 = 0 

The numbering convention used in the Taylor series is 
shown in red above (even potentially zero-value 
terms are numbered)
