INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Taylor Series

• An approximating tool that translates between 
the worlds of the infinitesimal and the finite
• Developed by Brook Taylor in the early 18th
century
• This ‘translator’ allows us to: 

- approximate functions with polynomials 
of arbitrary size when derivatives are known
- approximate derivatives of functions 
when function values are known
