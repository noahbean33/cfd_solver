What this Course DOES NOT Have

- Exhaustive Intro to Fluid Dynamics/Thermodynamics
- Grid generation

- LES / DES

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Mission Statement

Equip the student with the means to:
(1) Navigate the “fidelity-ladder” of the Navier-Stokes 
equations to find a suitable model
(2) Tailor a finite-difference scheme with a desired 
level of accuracy and stability (and be able to predict 
how it will behave before writing a single line of code) 
(3) Write/extend/run/validate a CFD solver in two 
spatial dimensions or more

History of

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

The “FD”

- Fluid dynamical equations 
assembled over two centuries
- Euler applied Newton’s 
conservation of momentum 
law to “perfect” fluids
- Navier, Stokes extend Euler’s 
equation to “viscous” fluids

Stokes

The “C”

- Richardson used ‘finite differences’ to 
compute stresses in a masonry dam (1910)
- Realized that this technique could work in 
meteorology too
- Completed calculation of a single day’s 
weather while transporting injured soldiers 
during the Battle of Champagne

Stokes completes assembly of 
fluid dynamical equations

Seventy years go by

Richardson attempts the first weather 
forecast using a finite-difference 
approximation of the equations

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

- Richardson divided the global 
atmosphere into 12000 cells
- Each cell spanned 200 km in north-
south direction, 3o in east-west direction 
and 1/5th the vertical span of the 
atmosphere
- He initialized his atmosphere to 
conditions observed on May 10th 1910
- He advanced the state of his 
atmosphere 6 hours at a time, by solving 
his finite-difference approximation of 
the fluid dynamical equations
- His computational result was… 
UNDERWHELMING

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Richardson’s grid

“The rate of rise of surface pressure, is found […] as 145 
millibars in 6 hours, whereas observations show that the 
barometer was nearly steady. This glaring error is examined 
in detail below […] and is traced to errors in the 
representation of the initial wind.”

- L.F.Richardson (Weather Prediction by Numerical Process) 

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

The Juggernaut Rolls On
- By the 1940s, Richardson’s slide 
rule and paper was replaced by 
vacuum tubes and punch cards
- First computer-based weather 
prediction performed in 1950 
(Charney, Von Neumann)
- As compute power grows over the 
next fifty years, increasingly 
complicated solution methodologies 
are introduced and tested on 
increasingly complex applications
